poet, the great dramatist, the strong and subtle
searcher of hearts, the just and merciful judge and

<h2 class="centrehead">PREFACE</h2>


<p><b>Early Editions.</b> On 3rd April, 1592, ‘<i>The Tragedie of
Arden of Feversham and Blackwall</i>’<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was entered on the
Stationers’ Registers to Edward White. In the same year
appeared, ‘<i>The lamentable and true Tragedie of M. Arden of
Feversham in Kent. Who was most wickedlye murdered, by
the meanes of his disloyall and wanton wyfe, who for the love
she bare to one Mosbie, hyred two desperat ruffins, Blackwill
and Shakbag, to kill him. Wherin is shewed the great mallice
and discimulation of a wicked woman, the unsatiable desire
of filthie lust and the shamefull end of all murderers. Imprinted
at London for Edward White, dwelling at the lyttle
North dore of Paules Church at the signe of the Gun.</i> 1592.’
A second Quarto, with the same title, was printed in 1599. A
third, ‘<i>by Eliz. Allde dwelling neere Christs Church</i>,’ appeared
in 1633. The second and third Quartos are founded textually
upon the first, and their variations are of no value. The text
of the first Quarto is unusually good even when prose and
verse are mixed together, although the printer has apparently
no scientific knowledge of the nature of metre.</p>

<p><b>Place of the Play in the Elizabethan Drama.</b> <i>Arden of
Faversham</i> is the finest extant specimen of a kind of play which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
has been classified as Domestic Tragedy. A picturesque or
sensational murder in the sixteenth century was given to the
public first in popular ballads or pamphlets, and afterwards, if
sufficiently notable, in the more serious Chronicle. From the
popular pamphlet, or from the Chronicle, or from both together,
it found its way on to the stage. Four of these ‘murder-plays’
have come down to us, and the titles of many others. They
form a minor section of the Chronicle plays or Histories. They
did not attain any very striking literary development, owing
perhaps to the necessary bondage of the poet to his facts.
<i>Arden of Faversham</i> is a remarkable instance of the possibilities
of this class of play, but it is to be noted that the poet
used the narrative of a Chronicler who wrote twenty-seven
years after the date of the murder. <i>A Warning for Fair
Women</i> and Yarington’s <i>Two Tragedies in One</i> are both inferior
to <i>Arden</i>, though influenced by it. The fourth ‘murder-play’&mdash;<i>The
Yorkshire Tragedy</i>&mdash;is distinct from the other three
in style and method. Several famous dramatists produced
‘domestic’ tragedies, but none have survived. <i>A Late Murder
of the Son upon the Mother</i>, in which Ford and Webster collaborated,
must have been a notable piece of work.</p>


<p><b>Source of the Play.</b> On Sunday, 15th February 1550-1,
Thomas Ardern of Faversham, gentleman, ‘was heynously
murdered in his own parlour, about seven of the clock in the
night, by one Thomas Morsby, a taylor of London, late servant
to sir Edward North, knight, chancellor of the augmentations,
father-in-law unto Alice Ardern, wife of the said Thomas
Ardern.’ Thomas Ardern was Mayor of Faversham in 1548,
and his murder made such a stir that in 1577 the first edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of Holinshed’s <i>Chronicle</i> devotes five pages (pp. 1703-8) to an
elaborate account of it. The chronicler begins thus:&mdash;‘About
this time there was at Faversham in Kent a Gentleman named
Arden most cruelly murthered and slain by the procurement of
his own wife. The which murder for the horribleness thereof,
although otherwise it may seem to be but a private matter, and
therefore as it were impertinent to this History, I have thought
good to set it forth somewhat at large, having the instructions
delivered to me by them that have used some diligence to
gather the true understanding of the circumstances.’ Our first
quotation was from the <i>Wardmote Book of Faversham</i>, and
proves that Holinshed’s narrative is not minutely accurate.
The <i>Wardmote Book</i> gives a curt account of the actual murder
on the Sunday evening with the names and fate of the culprits.
It tells us nothing of the previous failures of these culprits which
give to Holinshed’s tale such a terrible and dramatic interest.
We need not speculate on Holinshed’s sources. No doubt
there were many contemporary pamphlets and ballads which
recounted the murder. We know only of <i>The Complaint ... of
Mistress Arden of Feversham</i>, preserved among the <i>Roxburghe
Ballads</i>, and reprinted by Evans and in Miss De
Vaynes’ <i>Kentish Garland</i>. But this is dated by Mr. Bullen
about 1633, when the third Quarto of the play appeared, and
was probably occasioned by that re-issue. The important
point to bear in mind is the excellence of Holinshed’s narrative.
To praise it adequately we must say that it is worthy of the fine
play founded upon it, which probably had no other source.
The play agrees always with Holinshed when Holinshed differs
from the <i>Wardmote Book</i>. When the play differs from Holinshed
it differs also from the <i>Wardmote Book</i>. To the dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
instinct of the poet we must ascribe his suppression of the fact
that Arden winked at his wife’s infidelity. Holinshed and the
<i>Wardmote Book</i> both explicitly assert this. Franklin, Arden’s
friend, is also an invention of the dramatist.</p>


<p><b>Author of the Play.</b> The three Quartos are all anonymous.
We know of no other edition till 1770, when Edward Jacob,
a Faversham antiquary, edited the first Quarto, and boldly
claimed the play for Shakespeare. Ludwig Tieck published in
1823 an excellent German translation, accompanied by a discriminating
statement of the case for the Shakesperean authorship.
Delius, editing the play in 1855, agreed with Tieck, and
was followed by the French translator, François Victor Hugo,
and more recently by Professor Mézières. Owing to the supposed
Shakespearean authorship there have been at least three
translations into German, one into French, and one into Dutch.
In England opinion has been more divided. Henry Tyrrell,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Charles Knight, and Mr. Swinburne<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> have supported the Shakespearean
authorship. Professor Ward<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and J. A. Symonds
incline to reject it. Professor Saintsbury considers that ‘the
only possible hypothesis on which it could be admitted as
Shakespeare’s would be that of an early experiment thrown off
while he was seeking his way in a direction where he found no
thoroughfare.’<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Mr. Bullen, who edited a careful reprint of the
first Quarto in 1887, suspects ‘that <i>Arden</i> in its present state
has been retouched here and there by the master’s hand.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
The latest German editors, Warnke and Proescholt (1888), ‘are
of opinion that Shakespeare had nothing to do with <i>Arden of
Faversham</i>.’</p>

<p><b>The Question of Shakespeare’s Authorship.</b> The only
reason for ascribing the play to Shakespeare is its merit. It
seems incredible that a drama so mature in its art should have
been written in 1592 by a writer otherwise unknown to us. In
three directions the art of the writer is mature. First, the
character of the base coward Mosbie, and of the ‘bourgeois
Clytemnestra,’ Alice Arden, are drawn with an insight, delicacy,
and sustained power new to English literature in 1592, and not
excelled till Shakespeare excelled them. The picture of Arden,
as a man fascinated and bewitched by his wife and by his fate,
might match that of Mosbie and Alice if the artist had not
blurred his conception by the introduction of the jarring motives
of avarice and sacrilege. But the poet’s aim is clear; it is his
own, and it almost succeeds. Second, the picturesque ferocity
and grim humour of Black Will and Shakebag are described
with a firmness and ease and restraint of style which critics
have not sufficiently noted. I can compare it only with the
Jack Cade scenes of the <i>Contention</i> (and <i>2 Henry VI.</i>). The
prose of our poet is excellent. His humour has a clearly
defined character and style of its own. The character of
Michael, so admired by Mr. Swinburne, is as subtle and
well-sustained as Mosbie’s or Alice Arden’s, and it exhibits
our poet’s special humorous gift. This gift, excellent as it
is, seems to me very definitely not Shakespearean. But
thirdly, the terrifying use of signs and omens and of an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Shakespearean irony&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Arden’s words, ‘I am almost stifled
with this fog!’&mdash;combine to produce as the play proceeds an
impressive sense of ‘the slow unerring tread of assassination,
balked but persevering, marching like a fate to its accomplishment.’
But the special excellencies of the play are all against
Shakespeare having written it by 1592. As Mr. Bullen insists,
the weak point in Mr. Swinburne’s criticism is the phrase
‘a young man’s work.’ This play is not ‘a young man’s work.’
The copiousness of the young man Shakespeare’s work is the
exact contrary of the deliberate anxious effort which marks the
style of <i>Arden of Faversham</i> except in the prose scenes. In
none of Shakespeare’s plays can it be perceived that the poet
has taken such pains as the poet of <i>Arden</i> takes. Unless
Shakespeare wrote this play as soon as he reached London,
and then for a year or two wrote nothing else, it is impossible
to fit it into his work. And if he wrote the play as soon
as he reached London and then took up the studies which
resulted in <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>Lucrece</i>, would he have
written <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> and <i>Comedy of Errors</i> on his
way back to work like <i>Arden</i>? If Shakespeare wrote <i>Arden</i>
it is the most interesting fact in his literary development.
To suggest that Shakespeare revised the play is to shirk
the question. Its excellence is in its warp and woof, not in its
ornaments.</p>


<p><b>Literature.</b> Mr. Bullen’s <i>Introduction</i> is the best monograph
on the play. Warnke and Proescholt’s <i>Introduction</i>
should be consulted, but lacks the distinction of style and the
critical insight of Mr. Bullen’s essay. Excellent analyses and
criticisms of the play are in Charles Knight’s <i>Doubtful Plays</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
(‘Pictorial Shakespere’); J. A. Symonds’ <i>Shakspere’s Predecessors</i>;
Alfred Mézières’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prédécesseurs et Contemporains de
Shakspeare</i>. Mr. Fleay in his <i>Biographical Chronicle of the
English Drama</i> (1891) has suggested Kyd as the author of
<i>Arden</i>.</p>

<span class="i0">A toil was pitched to overthrow the deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I upon a little rising hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood whistly watching for the herd’s approach.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Even there, methoughts, a gentle slumber took me,                   <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summoned all my parts to sweet repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the pleasure of this golden rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ill-thewed foster had removed the toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rounded me with that beguiling home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which late, methought, was pitched to cast the deer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that he blew an evil-sounding horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the noise another herdman came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With falchion drawn, and bent it at my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying aloud, ‘Thou art the game we seek!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this I woke and trembled every joint,                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one obscured in a little bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sees a lion foraging about,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He pries about with timorous suspect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the thorny casements of the brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will not think his person dangerless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quakes and shivers, though the cause be gone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, trust me, Franklin, when I did awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood in doubt whether I waked or no:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such great impression took this fond surprise.                      <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">III.</span> v. 133. Warnke explains ‘the quarrel has not yet thickened

</div><div class="directioncenter">
<i>Here enters Will, Shakebag, and Greene.</i>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Will.</i> Sirrah Greene, when was I so long in killing a man?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">hanged at his door for our labour.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Will.</i> Thou knowest, Greene, that I have lived in London<br /></span>
<span class="i0">this twelve years, where I have made some go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">upon wooden legs for taking the wall on me; divers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">with silver noses for saying ‘There goes Black Will!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have cracked as many blades as thou hast nuts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Will.</i> Faith, in a manner I have. The bawdy-houses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">have paid me tribute; there durst not a whore set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">up, unless she have agreed with me first for opening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">her shop-windows. For a cross word of a tapster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have pierced one barrel after another with my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">dagger, and held him by the ears till all his beer<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<span class="i0">hath run out. In Thames Street a brewer’s cart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">was like to have run over me: I made no more ado,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">but went to the clerk and cut all the notches of his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">tallies and beat them about his head. I and my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">company have taken the constable from his watch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and carried him about the fields on a coltstaff. I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">have broken a sergeant’s head with his own mace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and bailed whom I list with my sword and buckler.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the tenpenny-alehouses-men would stand every<br /></span>
<span class="i0">morning with a quart-pot in their hand, saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Will it please your worship drink?’ He that had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">not done so, had been sure to have had his sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pulled down and his lattice borne away the next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">night. To conclude, what have I not done? yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">cannot do this; doubtless, he is preserved by<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
